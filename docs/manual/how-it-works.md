# How does it work?

## No Mods
Yes, you heard that right... There are *no* mods. You're the engine that makes it work! You manually perform the checks with the client, and you manually limit the items you can use in-game using the item list in the client. Some have called Manual "the honor system"! (This also means that you can play games that wouldn't allow modding, like board games, physical games, etc.)
