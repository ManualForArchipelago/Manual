# What is Manual?

Manual is a customizable apworld for Archipelago that allows you to make a custom multiworld integration for any game by specifying a list of items that you can receive and a list of locations that you can check.

The name "Manual" comes from the fact that it doesn't automatically randomize anything. Rather, you manually handle when locations are checked off the list, and you limit the items that you can use in-game until they are sent to you in the multiworld. Some call it the "honor system"!

Locations can be locations in the game, goals that you have in a bingo-style format, or even timer-based goals like ArchipIdle might use! Same with items... They can be actual items in the game, or limiting factors to add more of a challenge, or even arbitrary keys that gate certain areas of the game to create a keysanity-like play mode!

This system understandably doesn't work for very linear games, since you have to have some method of navigating the game to unlock items and locations normally. However, it does work well for a wide variety of use cases, including:

- Video games across multiple genres
   - Especially games with open locations or new game plus modes
- Board or card games, or other physical games
- Even things that aren't even games!
