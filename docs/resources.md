# Manual APWorld Sheet Template
We've created a Google Sheets template to help with organizing your items, regions and logic before implementation. It includes conditional formatting and a small addition to help count locations reachable without logic and locations in a region.

The sheet is available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUk_V5N0RgYASlpxDWNwZlfOb6NQ2DlG5s-tDHSxbN8/edit#gid=0
It's view-only. To get your own editable copy, go to File -> Make a copy. You can then edit the copy to your liking to fit your world's specific documentation needs.

# Logic visualizers
Some tools can help with visualizing your game's structure.
https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/ allows you to make a node graph that you can use to represent aspects of your logic.

# Manual Builder
Fuzzy has developed a Builder for Manual that has an user interface instead of interacting directly with the .jsons.
It can be found at https://fuzzygameson.github.io/ManualBuilder/

It's in a very early state, so documentation is expected to change. I would still recommend reading through <#1101576709058334720>, as all the rules of how each feature is used are the same, though you won't need to pay attention to the minute details of formatting for each one.

Please report any bugs you find in <#1097538232914296944> or <#1098306155492687892>, and if you see anything missing, there's always the <#1100822454206730270> forum.
