# User-Created Tools

We've had some users create tools that they found helpful in their own world creation, or that they feel close some gaps in the current Manual tooling! You can find those tools in the (Tools forum in the Manual Discord server)[https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1399211685239193743].

If you have any ideas for tools that would help you out, feel free to post those there as well! That forum accepts ideas, even if you're not quite ready (or able) to build them. :)
