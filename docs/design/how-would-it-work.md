# How would your randomizer work?

Deciding some things about your game beforehand can save you future headaches.
One major one is how your progression is handled. Is it vanilla, with the Manual items acting as "permission" to use the items you got naturally? Is your player maybe starting from a 100% save file, but with limited access defined by their items? Are there cheat tables, mods or in-game consoles they can use to cheat items in instead? Maybe you're working on a challenge-focused rando, like a move randomizer, or a meta-game with its own rules. You could even be implementing a game where the "Items" are more of an illusion to begin with, like characters in fighting games. Point is: what are your options, and what do you want to do with them?

## What is the intended flow of your Manual?

Think of your logic- not exactly, just in broad terms. Are you designing something line a linear platformer or metroidvania, with a lot of hard requirements? Or are you making something where most things don't have a requirement, with a giant sphere 1? Is your goal to win the game? A Macguffin hunt? Or completion of a set of goals? Bingo boards?
This can be a good time to add artificial logic to space out your spheres, as well.
