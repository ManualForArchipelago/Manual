# Minimizing filler items

Specifically, literal nothing items, not Filler items that do something minor. Your amount of Junk items doesn't necessarily impact you. However, it will impact the experience of other players, in a similar way to settings like Hollow Knight Geosanity or Ocarina of Time Potsanity: sending trash more often than not. Except, in this case, it's a literal nothing.

There are occasionally games where junk is simply inevitable by limitations of design. However, there are usually ways to address this:

- Add duplicates of your progression items (or extra copies of your progressive/count items). This also helps if you are having pacing issues, or a game with very frequent BK issues.
- Add better filler. You looked up cheat sheets in a prior step. Can you add free ammo refills? Extra lives? Free powerups? Anything that is minorly helpful, but still fulfills its role as filler.
- Reduce your locations. You may want to check as many locations as possible, but sometimes a game with very few items should have just as few locations. Sometimes a game has few items and a ton of natural, obvious locations. Sometimes, it's avoidable location bloat.
- Rethink the details of your implementation. Was there a type of item you didn't randomize before? Maybe it wouldn't add new locations, but would add more items and logic variety. Did you have an item that could be subdivided for a more interesting implementation? (e.g Weapons, "Cut Rope", etc. into specifics)
- Traps
