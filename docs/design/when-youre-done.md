# The world is done... Now what?

With the world done, you have little left to do in terms of design or decisions. However, there are a few things left to keep in mind.

## Distribution
If you want others to play your manual world as well, your template .yaml, .apworld and documentation need to reach players. You can create a thread in our Discord in the #video-games, #board-card-games or #meta-games for it. Your documentation can all go in the thread, but this can lack portability of your Manual. As such, I would recommend providing one .ZIP file download for all your files, including your .yaml and .apworld, but especially any other external tools or docs necessary to play the Manual. Even better would be to set up a GitHub repository for your apworld(s)!
  
## Pinning
With your thread made and your Manual distributed, you can also request to have important messages in your thread pinned by pinging the @Moderators role in our Discord from that thread.
