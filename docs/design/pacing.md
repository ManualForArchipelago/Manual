# Does your randomizer have good, consistent pacing?

Some games are just async-only by nature. Some are really short. Whatever it is, it's important to be aware of it and have some consistency with it.
 
One source of pacing issues can be an excessively large sphere 1, leading the playthrough logic to expect you to go everywhere at once, leaving others in extended BK. To deal with this, you can add artificial logic gating- anything that makes sense within your world's context, such as stronger gear, area keys, etc. (See #"Desktop Dungeons (Alpha and 2013)" for an example in practice)

Your game might just be too long, especially if you want to play it in a sync. In these cases, it can help to cut down and make your own goal. If you're designing a Manual for an 8-chapter game that you want to be sync-viable, but it's just way too long, then maybe your solution is a "Short" version that only goes up to Chapter 4 as the victory condition. 

On the flipside, you could be randomizing a retro platformer that doesn't last that long. Do you have a level select cheat? You could lock areas with keys, again. If not, there's always move rando to add difficulty instead. Maybe if there's multiple short games you want to play, but you can't see yourself extending their length artificially in any fun way, you could group them together.
