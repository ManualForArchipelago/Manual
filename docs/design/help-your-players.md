# Telling your players what they need to know

Normally, it would be ideal for as much of a world as possible to be self-explanatory. Sometimes, however, that's just not possible without sacrificing something else, like overly verbose names, messy victory conditions, etc.

You can supplement this with your documentation: explain the rules, explain how your world works, its limitations, it's mechanics. Ideally, you can make as much as possible self-explanatory in a reasonable way, and then document away whatever doubt is left. Documentation can also have other uses, such as pointing to the mods or cheat sheets you may have found earlier, or favoring specific versions of a game for its compatibility.

Your docs should mimic some of the information that you'd find on the AP website for a normal supported AP game. Treat it as the point of entry for any new players, and tell them what they need to get started. Beyond that, you could mention any "gotcha" information (unexpected logic or design things) and any customization or options you give the player to change their gameplay experience. 

You can find some good examples of documentation things in Axxroy's Monster Hunter Rise game thread in our Discord!
