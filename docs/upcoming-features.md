Due to the early state of Manual, there are a lot of features that Fuzzy has already explicitly confirmed wanting to add, that keep coming up in conversations. As such, we thought it would be useful for both players and Manual apworld creators to have a list of upcoming features. I will try to keep this updated with any other recurring topics that Fuzzy confirms intent to implement.

Ideas from <#1100822454206730270> will be moved here if Fuzzy opts to add them to the planned features list.

As of now, we have:
### [Logic]
- Locations requiring Locations to simulate event flags or regions
- Having the location requires infer what items should be marked as progression automatically
- (In <#1097891385190928504>) Progression_Skip_Balancing as an item flag

### [Client]
- Global scroll bar?
- Deathlink

### [APworld / Other]
- (In <#1097891385190928504>) Starting Inventory defined in world
- Further options for defining starting inventory in the world
