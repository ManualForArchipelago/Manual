# Downloading a Manual Game

This post assumes you are familiar with local generation of officially supported games, as that is outside the scope of Manual's documentation.
If you are not, please read through AP's guide on multiworld setup first: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en

1. Locate the worlds you want to play and their associated yamls, as well as the location of your Archipelago installation.
2. Go into your Archipelago folder, then into the `lib` folder, then the `worlds` folder. You should see all your existing worlds; move the Manual .apworlds here as well.
3. (Recommended): Download [Universal Tracker](https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1176939614985011200) and add it to lib/worlds
