# Downloading a Manual Game

This post assumes you are familiar with local generation of officially supported games, as that is outside the scope of Manual's documentation.
If you are not, please read through AP's guide on multiworld setup first: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en

1. Locate the worlds you want to play and their associated yamls, as well as the location of your Archipelago installation.
2. Go into your Archipelago install's folder, then into the `custom_worlds` folder. Move the Manual .apworlds here.
3. Still in your Archipelago install's folder, go into the `Players` folder. Move the Manual .yamls here.
4. (Recommended): Download Universal Tracker from [their channel's pins in the Archipelago Discord](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1367270230635839539) (recommended) or from [their GitHub releases](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases?q=Tracker&expanded=true), and add it to your Archipelago install's "custom_worlds" folder.
