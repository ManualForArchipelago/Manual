# Playing a Manual

1. Either use a provided yaml, or click the "Generate Template Options" button in the launcher to generate one.
![Generate Template Options](/docs/img/resources/generate-templates.png)
2. Place your Manual yamls into the `Players` folder, like you would with official Yamls
4. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe to generate a multiworld in the `output` folder.
5. Upload that generation to the website, at https://archipelago.gg/start-playing, to host it on the webhost
   * Alternatively, you can run ArchipelagoServer.exe and select your output file from your `output` folder (or drag it onto ArchipelagoServer.exe), to host it locally
6. Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe to bring up the normal AP launcher and look for a button that says "Manual Client". You may need to scroll down.
   * If you have it, click it.
   * If you don't have it, download the apworld [here](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual/releases/latest) and put it in the same `lib/worlds` folder as your apworld.
7. Input the server address and port as usual, then input your game's full ID in the "Manual Game ID" field (this is the same one found in your yaml and .apworld name, **which you should not change**), then click "Connect".
   * Your Game ID will look like `Manual_Autonauts_Hopop`.  **Do not change the author's name to your own.**
8. You are now connected. Head to the "Manual" tab and click on location names as you complete them to send out their contents. Click on the "Victory" location once you reach your goal.
